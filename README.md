# Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-RAG-model
This project implements (RAG) model that combines information retrieval and generative AI to provide contextually relevant and accurate answers.The system retrieves relevant documents or text chunks from a knowledge base using similarity search and then passes this context to a large language model (LLM) to generate human-like responses.
